recipe:
1. Spread butter on all the bread slices. Cover the whole surface with the butter. You can slice of the edges if you prefer.
2.Top half of the slices with grated cheese. sprinkle 2 to 3 pinches each of roasted cumin powder, chaat masala powder and black pepper on the grated cheese in each slice.
3. Cover the cheese-topped slices with the remaining buttered slices and spread butter on the top of the slices.
4. In a preheated grill, place the sandwich carefully with the buttered side facing down, making sure your hands donâ€™t touch the grill (be careful when doing this. If you cannot do this then just skip the above step. Instead spread butter once the cheese sandwich are grilled). Now spread butter on the top side which is facing you.

6.Serve the grilled cheese sandwich hot with tomato ketchup or green chutney.
